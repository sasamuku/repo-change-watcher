# Product Context: Repository Sprint Digest

## Problem Statement
Development teams using GitHub often struggle with:
- Tracking what changes were merged during a sprint
- Maintaining visibility of team progress across multiple days
- Creating comprehensive change logs for sprint reviews
- Documenting development activities without manual effort

Manual tracking of merged PRs is time-consuming and error-prone, while existing automated solutions often lack the specific organization and formatting needed for effective sprint reviews.

## Solution
Repository Sprint Digest solves these problems by:
1. Automatically monitoring merged PRs in specified repositories
2. Recording PR details in a structured, date-organized format
3. Supporting multiple output formats to fit different documentation needs
4. Avoiding duplicate entries to maintain data integrity
5. Providing both automated (scheduled) and manual execution options

## User Experience Goals
- **Minimal Configuration**: Users should be able to set up the tool with minimal configuration
- **Set and Forget**: Once configured, the tool should work reliably without requiring ongoing attention
- **Flexible Output**: Users should be able to choose how and where the PR history is recorded
- **Seamless Integration**: The tool should integrate naturally into existing GitHub workflows
- **Clear Documentation**: Users should easily understand how to configure and use the tool

## Target Users
1. **Development Teams**: Teams using GitHub for collaborative development who need to track progress
2. **Scrum Masters/Project Managers**: Those responsible for facilitating sprint reviews and tracking team progress
3. **Technical Leads**: Those who need to maintain awareness of all changes being merged into the codebase
4. **Documentation Specialists**: Those responsible for maintaining change logs and release notes

## Usage Scenarios

### Daily Team Standup
A development team uses the daily-generated PR digest to quickly review what was completed the previous day, helping to keep everyone informed about recent changes without manually checking GitHub.

### Sprint Review
At the end of a sprint, the team has a comprehensive, chronologically organized list of all merged PRs, making it easy to review what was accomplished and discuss the work with stakeholders.

### Release Documentation
When preparing release notes, the team can reference the accumulated PR digest to ensure all changes are properly documented, without having to manually compile the information from GitHub.

### Cross-Team Coordination
Teams working on different repositories can use the digest to maintain awareness of changes in related codebases, improving coordination and reducing integration issues.

## Value Proposition
Repository Sprint Digest saves development teams time and improves visibility by automating the tedious task of tracking and documenting merged PRs. It transforms raw GitHub activity into structured, date-organized information that supports effective team communication and project management.
