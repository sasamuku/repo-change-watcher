# Progress: Repository Sprint Digest

## What Works
- âœ… **Core PR Monitoring**: Successfully fetches merged PRs from specified repositories
- âœ… **Date-Based Organization**: Correctly groups PRs by their merge date
- âœ… **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports Markdown, JSON, and YAML output formats
- âœ… **Duplicate Prevention**: Properly checks for and prevents duplicate PR entries
- âœ… **GitHub Action Integration**: Functions as a GitHub Action with appropriate inputs and outputs
- âœ… **Local Execution**: Can be run locally with command-line arguments or environment variables
- âœ… **Pagination Support**: Handles repositories with up to 300 PRs (3 pages of 100)
- âœ… **Incremental Updates**: Preserves existing content when updating files

## What's Left to Build
- ðŸ”„ **Configuration Files**: Investigate and implement the purpose of `config/repos.yaml` and `config/keywords.json`
- ðŸ”„ **Enhanced Testing**: Develop comprehensive tests for different scenarios and edge cases
- ðŸ”„ **Future Enhancements**: Implement the potential enhancements mentioned in the README:
  - AI-powered PR summary generation
  - Weekly/sprint rollup summaries
  - Customizable PR filtering options
  - Statistical analysis of PR trends
  - Integration with notification platforms
  - Automated meeting agenda generation

## Current Status
The project is in a functional state with all core features implemented. It can be used as a GitHub Action or run locally to monitor merged PRs and generate formatted output files. The codebase is well-structured and follows good practices for maintainability.

The main areas for improvement are:
1. Understanding and implementing the purpose of the configuration files
2. Developing a more comprehensive testing strategy
3. Implementing the planned enhancements to add more value

## Known Issues
1. **Pagination Limit**: Currently limited to 300 PRs (3 pages), which might not be sufficient for very active repositories
2. **No Explicit Error Handling** for certain edge cases:
   - What happens if the GitHub API is unavailable?
   - How does it handle rate limiting?
   - What if the output file becomes very large over time?
3. **Configuration Files**: The purpose and implementation of `config/repos.yaml` and `config/keywords.json` are unclear
4. **No Automated Tests**: The project lacks automated tests to ensure reliability across different scenarios

## Next Development Priorities
1. **Investigate Configuration Files**: Determine the purpose and implement support for `config/repos.yaml` and `config/keywords.json`
2. **Implement Testing**: Add automated tests to ensure reliability
3. **Address Pagination Limitations**: Consider options for handling repositories with more than 300 PRs
4. **Documentation Improvements**: Enhance documentation with more examples and use cases
5. **Implement High-Value Enhancements**: Prioritize and implement the most valuable enhancements from the planned list

## Recent Achievements
- Initial documentation of the project in the Memory Bank
- Understanding of the project structure and functionality
