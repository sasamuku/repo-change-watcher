# Progress: Repository Sprint Digest

## What Works
- ✅ **Core PR Monitoring**: Successfully fetches merged PRs from specified repositories
- ✅ **Date-Based Organization**: Correctly groups PRs by their merge date
- ✅ **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports Markdown, JSON, and YAML output formats
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Properly checks for and prevents duplicate PR entries
- ✅ **GitHub Action Integration**: Functions as a GitHub Action with appropriate inputs and outputs
- ✅ **Local Execution**: Can be run locally with command-line arguments or environment variables
- ✅ **Pagination Support**: Handles repositories with up to 300 PRs (3 pages of 100)
- ✅ **Incremental Updates**: Preserves existing content when updating files

## What's Left to Build
- 🔄 **AI Summarization Feature**: Implement the planned AI-powered PR summary generation:
  - ✅ Design and document the approach (completed)
  - 🔄 Install required dependencies (LangChain, OpenAI)
  - 🔄 Create AI processing module
  - 🔄 Extend GitHub API interaction
  - 🔄 Implement summarization logic
  - 🔄 Integrate with output formats
- 🔄 **Configuration Files**: Investigate and implement the purpose of `config/repos.yaml`
- 🔄 **Enhanced Testing**: Develop comprehensive tests for different scenarios and edge cases
- 🔄 **Future Enhancements**: Consider implementing other potential enhancements mentioned in the README:
  - Weekly/sprint rollup summaries
  - Customizable PR filtering options
  - Statistical analysis of PR trends
  - Integration with notification platforms
  - Automated meeting agenda generation

## Current Status
The project is in a functional state with all core features implemented. It can be used as a GitHub Action or run locally to monitor merged PRs and generate formatted output files. The codebase is well-structured and follows good practices for maintainability.

We are now in the planning phase for adding AI-powered PR summarization, with the design and documentation completed. This enhancement will add significant value by making PR digests more informative and easier to understand at a glance.

The main areas for improvement are:
1. Implementing the AI summarization feature
2. Understanding and implementing the purpose of the configuration files
3. Developing a more comprehensive testing strategy

## Known Issues
1. **Pagination Limit**: Currently limited to 300 PRs (3 pages), which might not be sufficient for very active repositories
2. **No Explicit Error Handling** for certain edge cases:
   - What happens if the GitHub API is unavailable?
   - How does it handle rate limiting?
   - What if the output file becomes very large over time?
3. **Configuration Files**: The purpose and implementation of `config/repos.yaml` is unclear
4. **No Automated Tests**: The project lacks automated tests to ensure reliability across different scenarios
5. **API Cost Management**: Need to implement strategies to manage OpenAI API costs effectively

## Next Development Priorities
1. **Implement AI Summarization Feature**: Follow the implementation plan in `docs/ai-summary-feature.md`
2. **Investigate Configuration Files**: Determine the purpose and implement support for `config/repos.yaml`
3. **Implement Testing**: Add automated tests to ensure reliability, including tests for the new AI features
4. **Address Pagination Limitations**: Consider options for handling repositories with more than 300 PRs
5. **Documentation Improvements**: Update documentation to include information about the new AI features

## Recent Achievements
- Initial documentation of the project in the Memory Bank
- Understanding of the project structure and functionality
- Designed and documented the AI summarization feature
- Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the AI enhancement
